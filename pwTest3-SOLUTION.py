Lines 68-71 fixed by way of adding a utf range code checker.

Protect the password function against a poison NULL byte


RULE: A strong password requires

1) a minimum of 8 Characters
2) at least one UpperCase Letter
3) at least one LowerCase Letter
4) at least one Number
5) at least one Special Character
6) no sequence of 3 or more repeating characters
7) no out of range chars i.e. escape sequences < ord 0x20 and > 0x7f
